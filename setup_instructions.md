Need this because for some reason the screenshots bluestacks produces are too restricted



To install: 
- mkdir Bluestacks_screenshots 
- create venv if wanted

- sudo apt install tesseract-ocr

- bluestacks 5
-- settings -> preferences -> media folder -> set to Bluestacks_screenshots
-- laax app
--- log in with some account that has "premium" 
-- macrodroid
-- clickmate
--- every 50 seconds, click "live" then "premium"


To run:
sudo bash perm_changer.sh
